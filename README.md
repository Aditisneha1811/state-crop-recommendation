# state-crop-recommendation
hello every this repository contains my very first data science project which is state crop recommendation 
Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops.

Machine learning is everywhere throughout the whole growing and harvesting cycle. It begins with a crop prediction — from the soil preparation, seeds breeding and water feed measurement — and it ends when robots pick up the harvest determining the ripeness with the help of computer vision.


In the crop recommendation, the user can provide the parameters like area,season ,district, year,production, crop from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

AREA – TOTAL AVAILABLE AREA FOR CULTIVATION.
PRODUCTION – PRODUCTION OF CROP IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR IS GIVEN IN DATASET AND EXPECTED PRODUCTION IS ASKED .
SEASON – SEASONS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANT GROWTH .
here i have collected the data set from kaggle 
and performed data cleaning and EDA on it
then divided the dataset as training and testing data 
and trained the data using different models 
and the output is launched using gradio

and for webdevelopment basic i have also created the webpage using flask
